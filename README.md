# odin-landing-page
This objective of this project will be to create a landing page that resembles the provided images. I will be using the html, css and flexbox skills I have learned.

I had some fun with this project and created a landing page for a website being run by dryads attempting to recruit humans into their realm.

The logo was created by me and the images are all free stock images from Pexels.com.
